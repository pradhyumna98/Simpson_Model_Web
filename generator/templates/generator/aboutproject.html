	<h1>About Project</h1>
    <h3>Brief Introduction</h3>
	<p>Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short, are an approach to generative modeling using deep learning 
    methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Dense Neural Networks.</p>
    <p>Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically 
    discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to 
    generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset and the generation 
    of images start from taking noise as input, i.e. here noise means random initialization of an array.</p>
    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
    <p><strong>Machine Learning and Deep Learning -</strong> The field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning are used 
    for Generator and Discriminator based GAN Model. And for the use of these technologies we will use either Jupyter 
    Notebook or Spyder Environment.</p>
    <p><strong>Python –</strong> The language to be used for making this project would be Python.</p>
    <p><strong>Web Technology –</strong> The final deployment of the software is made using Django framework which 
    follows Python Programming</p>
    <p><strong>Neural Networks –</strong> Neural Networks would be used as the base implementation of the project 
    available in Python under Keras Library. Mainly to types of networks will be used, Dense Network and Convolutional 
    Network.</p>
